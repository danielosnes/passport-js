What Are Database Relationships?
Review
<1 min
Well done! In this lesson, you have accomplished the following:

You learned about one-to-one relationship, created a new table, book_details to show its one-to-one correspondence with book and vice-versa, 
and imported dummy data and ran queries to validate the keys in the table.

You learned about one-to-many relationship, created a new table, page to show a one-to-many relationship between chapter and page, 
imported sample data and ran queries to validate the relationship.

You learned about many-to-many relationship, created a cross-reference table, books_authors, to bind both book and author into a many-to-many relationship, 
populated the table and ran queries to validate the relationship.

At this point, you have designed a solid book database schema that you can be proud of. If you were to import your schema into a database design software, 
you might have a schema diagram like the one on the right. Does it meet the requirements of a well-defined schema?

Are you able to do the following for your schema?

Name the tables in your schema.
Name the column names and types for each table in the schema.
Name the constraints for each table.
Name the relationships between tables.
Congratulations for a job well-done!!

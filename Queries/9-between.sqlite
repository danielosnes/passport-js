/*
The [BETWEEN] operator is used in a [WHERE] clause to filter the result set within a certain /range/.
It accepts two values that are either numbers, text or dates.

For example,
This statement filters the result set to only include movies with [year]s from 1990 up to and including 1999.

SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999;

When the valies are text, [BETWEEN] gilters the result set for within the alphabetical range.

In this statement, [BETWEEN] filters the result set to only include movies with the [name]s that begin with the letter 'A' up to BUT NOT INCLUDING 'J'.

SELECT * FROM movies WHERE name BETWEEN 'A' and 'J';

However if a movies has a name of simple 'J', it would actually match.
This is because [BETWEEN] goes UP to the second value = Up to 'J' So the movie named 'J would be included in the result set but not 'Jaws'

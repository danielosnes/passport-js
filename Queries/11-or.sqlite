/*
Similar to [AND], the [OR] operator can also be used to combine multiple conditions in [WHERE], but there is a fundamental difference.

    - [AND] operator displays a row if ALL of the conditions are true
    - [OR] operator displays a row if ANY condition is true

Suppose we want to check out a new movie or something action-packed:

SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year > 2014 OR genre = 'action';

[year > 2014] is the first parameter
[genre = 'action'] is the second condition
[OR] combines the two conditions

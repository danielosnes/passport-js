/*
OAuth is an AUTHORIZATION FRAMEWORK that provides specific authorization flows which allow unrelated servers to access authenticated resources without sharing any passwords.
It works by allowing applications to authenticate with third-party services in exchange for an ACCESS TOKEN which can be passed with an HTTP request to access protected content.

In this lesson, we will learn how to implement OAuth 2.0 which is a rewrite of OAuth 1.0.
It simplifies the process and introduces the following four OAuth roles:

1 - Resource Owner
    The user who authorizes an application to an account
2 - Resource Server
    The API server that accepts access tokens and verifies their validity
3 - Authorization Server
    The server that issues access tokens
4 - Client 
    the application that requests the access tokens

/**
 * Passport.js is a flexible authentication #middleware for #Node.js that can be added to any Express-based application.
 * With Passport.js we can implement authentication using the concept of #strategies.
 * 
 * Passport Strategies are separate modules created to work with different means of authentication.
 * Passport is a very extensible middleware,
 * and it allows you to plug in over 300 different authentication providers like Facebook, Twitter, Google and more.
 * 
 * In order to offer Passport-supported authentication.
 * we'll beed to install and configure the strategies modules that we'd like to use.
 * In this lesson, we'll be focussing on a Local Passport Strategie,
 * [passport-local] and authenticating users using a username and password.
 * 
 * We can take a look at the diagram to get an understanding of the authentication flow through Passport.js
 * And we'll go more in-depth as to how each step works in the following exercises.

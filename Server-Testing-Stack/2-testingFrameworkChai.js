When writing tests, 
sometimes you'll find that the tests require calculation steps or inline code to determine if the test is passing.
For example,
to test if an array [foo] includes an element [bar] using Mocha with the built-in Node assertion library,
we use the JavaScript [includes] helper:

assert.ok(foo.includes(bar));

to improve the readability and flow of our tests,
we extend the built-in Node assertion library with Chai.

const {assert} = require('chai');

The main function in Chai we are using is [.include()] - This allows us to rewrite the previous example as:

assert.include(foo, bar);

include also works to check that text contains certain values:

assert.includ('foobar', 'bar'); // Evaluates to true

The large set of assertion methods in the chai library enable us to write more expressive tests that are easy for developers to understand.

Instructions
Checkpoint 1 Passed
1.
In chai-test.js to the right, weâ€™ve included Chai at the top of the file and set up a describe block with Mocha. Use Chai on line 9 to assert that the foo array contains the number 4. Use npm test to verify the test is passing.

When you are ready to move on, check your work.

Use assert.include(). First argument is where you are looking (foo) and the second is what you are looking for (includedNumber).

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
In JavaScript, the .pop() method removes the final element from an array and returns it. Write an assertion to verify that the variable fooPop returned from the .pop() method returns the correct element from the array. Use npm test to verify the test is passing.

When you are ready to move on, check your work.

Use assert.equal() to check that fooPop is equal to includedNumber. Be sure to use fooPop as the first argument.

Checkpoint 3 Passed
3.
Since we popped the only element from the array, foo should be empty. To check this, assert that the length of foo is now zero. Use npm test to verify the test is passing.

When you are ready to move on, check your work.

Use assert.equal() to check that foo.length equals 0.

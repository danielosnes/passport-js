/*
Often the hardest part of creating a full-stack web-application is knowing where to start.
In this lesson, we will use an outside-in development process.
With this approach, we start to build our new functionality at the feature level.

Starting at the feature level of the pyramid (going outside-in) means you begin by writing tests that inform implementation of the code that a user's browser renders.
These test involve the aspects of your project that user will see and interact with.

In this lesson:

- You will learn a few tool for writing feature-level tests.

- You will go through a few rounds of the TDD cycle at the feature level to build an application that renders user input.

- You will end the lesson "in the red", with a failing feature-level test that you can only address by "dropping" to the server level.

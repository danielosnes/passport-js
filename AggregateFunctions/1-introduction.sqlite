/*
SQL Queries don't just access raw data, they can also perform calculations on the raw data to answer specific data questions.

calculations performed on multiple data rows of a table are called [aggregates]

In this lesson, we have given you a table named [fake_apps] which is made up of fake mobile applications data.

Here is a quick preview of some important aggregates that we will cover in the next five exercises.

[COUNT()] : Count the number of rows.

[SUM()] : The sum of the values in a column.

[MAX()]/[MIN()] : The largest/smallest value.

[AVG()] : The average of the values in a column.

[ROUND()] : Round the values in the column.

Let's get started!

/*
By default, SQL tries to be as precise as possible without rounding.
We can make the result table easier to read using the [ROUND()] function.

[ROUND()] function takes two arguments inside the parenthesis:
    1: a column name
    2: an INTEGER

It rounds the values in a column to the number of decimal places specified by the integer.

SELECT ROUND(price, 0)
FROM fake_apps;

Here we pass the column [price] and integer [0] as arguements.
SQL rounds the values in the column to 0 decimal places in the output.

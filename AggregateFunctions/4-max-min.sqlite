/*
The [MAX()] and [MIN()] function treturn the highest and lowest values in a column, respectively.

How many downloads does the most popular app have?

SELECT MAX(downloads) FROM fake_apps;

The most popular app has 31,090 downloads!

[MAX()] takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the largest value in that column.
Here, we returned the largest values in the [downloads] column.

[MIN()] works the same way but does the exact opposite. 
It returns the smallest value.

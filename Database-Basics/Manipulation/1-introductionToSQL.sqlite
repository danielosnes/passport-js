/*
SQL - Structured Query Language, is a programming language designed to manage data stored in relational databases.
SQL operates through simple, declaritive statements.
This keeps data accurate and secure, and helps maintain the integrity of databases, regardless of size.

The SQL language is widely used today across web framewords and database applications. 
Knowing SQL  gives you the freedom to explore your data, and the power to make better decisions.
By learning SQL, you will also learn concepts that apply to nearly every data storage system.

The statements covered in this course use SQLite Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).
You can also access a glossary of all the SQL commands taught in this course:

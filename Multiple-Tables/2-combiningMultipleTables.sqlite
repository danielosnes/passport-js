Let's return to our magazine company. 
Suppose we have the three tables described in the previous excercise :

orders
(a table with information on each magazine purchase)

order_id	customer_id	subscription_id	purchase date
1	2	3	2017-01-01
2	2	2	2017-01-01
3	3	1	2017-01-01

subscriptions
(a table that describes each type of subscription)

subscription_id	description	price_per_month	length
1	Politics Magazine	5	12 months
2	Fashion Magazine	10	6 months
3	Sports Magazine	7	3 months

customers
(a table with customer names and contact information)

customer_id	customer_name	address
1	John Smith	123 Main St
2	Jane Doe	456 Park Ave
3	Joe Schmo	798 Broadway

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

orders
subscriptions
customers

If we look at the orders table we can't really tell what's happened in each order,
however if we refer to the other tables, we can get a complete picture.

Let's examine the order with an order_id of 2.
It was purchased by the customer with a customer_id of 2.

To find out the customer's name,
we look at the customers table and look for the customer_id value of 2. 
We can see that Customer's 2 name is 'Jane Doe' and that she lives at '456 Park Ave'.

Doing this kind of matching is called Joining two tables.

Before:

orders

3	3	1	2017-01-01

subscriptions

subscription_id	description	price_per_month	length
1	Politics Magazine	5	12 months
2	Fashion Magazine	10	6 months

Type your answer on line 1 of the code editor (this is not a query).

Be sure to capitalize it the same as in the table.

First, we look at the orders table.

The order with an order_id of 1 is in the first row. Its subscription_id is 3.

Then we look at the subscriptions table.

The subscription with a subscription_id of 3 is in the third row. Its description is Sports Magazine.

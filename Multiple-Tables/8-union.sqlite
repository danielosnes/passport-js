/*
Sometimes, we just want to stack one dataset on top of the other. 
Well the [UNION] operator allows us to do that.

Suppose we have two tables and they have the same columns.

[table1]:
pokemon     	type
Bulbasaur	    Grass
Charmander  	Fire
Squirtle    	Water

[table2]:
pokemon         type
Snorlax         normal
If we combine these two with [UNION]

SELECT *
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT *
FROM table2;

The result would be:

pokemon     	type
Bulbasaur	    Grass
Charmander  	Fire
Squirtle    	Water
Snorlax         normal

SQL has strict rules for appending data:

Tables MUST have the same nnumber of columns

The columns MUST have the same data types in the same order as the first table.

SELECT *
FROM newspaper
UNION
SELECT * 
FROM online;
